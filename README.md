## About me

I’m fifth-year CS PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/)'s [Sprocket Lab](https://sprocketlab.github.io). My interests are machine learning for climate science and other scientific fields, with a particular focus on generative modeling for rare events and low-data tasks.

I also collaborate with and am mentored by [Allegra LeGrande](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/allegra.n.legrande) at [NASA GISS](https://www.giss.nasa.gov), where I previously completed a year-long Research Assistant appointment through the [Climate Change Research Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/climate-change-research-initiative/). Our ongoing work focuses on designing a diffusion model for simulating the evolution of cyclone storms. In Summer 2024 and Spring 2025, I also completed two NASA [OSTEM internships](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/internship-programs/) at GISS, where I worked with [Michael Hendrickson](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mhendrickson.html) to enable analysis of climate datasets with LLMs.
