## About me

I’m a third-year CS PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). My interests include machine learning for low-data regimes, as well as machine translation and using machine learning to model game-theoretic scenarios.

I’m also President of UW-Madison’s chapter of the [Women of the ACM (WACM)](https://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/) and a member of the Graduate Student Advisory Committee (GSAC) in the Computer Science Department.
