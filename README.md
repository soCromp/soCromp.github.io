## About me

I’m a second-year CS PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). I am interested in the intersection of game theory and machine learning, as well as machine learning in low-data regimes.

My current projects include:

- Autonomous Cyber Deception: Modeling autonomous cyber warfare from a game-theoretic perspective
- Comparing how ML models and humans learn rules in novel enviroments
- Fine-tuning large, general-purpose diffusion models to low-data regimes with weak supervision and active learning

I’m also President of UW-Madison’s chapter of the [Women of the ACM (WACM)](https://wacm.cs.wisc.edu/) and a member of the Graduate Student Advisory Committee (GSAC) in the Computer Science Department.
