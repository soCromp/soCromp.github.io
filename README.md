## About me

Iâ€™m a fourth-year CS PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). My interests include machine learning for scientific domains and low-data regimes.

I'm also grateful to work at [NASA GISS](https://www.giss.nasa.gov): I am a Research Assistant with [Allegra LeGrande](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/allegra.n.legrande) through the [Climate Change Research Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/climate-change-research-initiative/) and a Graduate Intern, working with [Michael Hendrickson](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mhendrickson.html) to enable analysis of climate datasets with LLMs. Please check out our recent AGU24 and NeurIPS workshop paper, Climate PAL: Enhancing Accessibility of Climate Model Data through Conversational AI, below!
